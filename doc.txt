The envsh command shell was created for CS 485-001,002.
The envsh shell executes the following built-in commands:

% any text

    The % command is a comment command. It tells your shell that this is simply a comment line. 
    Any text after the % will be ignored. The % must occur as the first token on the line.

prompt string

    Set the shell prompt to string. The default prompt should be "envsh > ".

setenv variable_name string

    This command sets the environment variable variable_name to the value contained in string. 
    The list of currently set environment variables should be passed to applications that are executed.

unsetenv variable_name

    This command removes the environment variable variable_name from the list of environment variables passed to applications.

listenv

    This command prints a list of the current environment variables and their values.

setdir directory_name

    This command sets the shell's concept of the current directory to directory_name. See getwd(3) and chdir(2) system calls.

bye

    Exit your shell program. 

===============================================================================================

The envsh shell also executes any programs called by the user.  Such user program commands have
the following syntax:

cmd [arg]* [< infile] [> outfile] 

NOTE: cmd must contain the full path for any program being called.

===============================================================================================

The scanner and parser for the envsh shell were created using flex and bison respectively.
The scanner tokenizing specifications are implemented in the file "scanner.l".
The parser is implemented in the file "parser.y".
